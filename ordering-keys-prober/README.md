### Introduction

The prober is designed to demonstrate effective use of Cloud Pub/Sub's
[ordered delivery](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).

### Building

These instructions assume you are using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

1.  If you want to build the connector from head, clone the repository, ensuring
    to do so recursively to pick up submodules:

    `git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsub`

2.  Unzip the source code if downloaded from the release version.

3.  Go into the ordering-keys-prober directory in the cloned repo.

4.  Make the jar that contains the connector:

    `mvn package`

The resulting jar is at target/pubsub-ordered-prober.jar.

### Running the Prober

After building the prober, use the following command to run it:

`java -cp target/pubsub-ordered-prober.jar com.google.cloud.pubsub.prober.ProberStarter --project <project ID>`

If you want to use a service account for the test, first set the
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:

`export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to json credentials file>`

When the prober starts up, it does the following:

1.  Deletes the topic and subscription provided if they already exist.

2.  Creates the topic and subscription provided.

3.  Sets up subscribers to receive messages.

4.  Continuously publishes messages.

### Prober Properties

The prober has many properties that can be set to test different load scenarios
and configurations. The following table details all of the command-line options
that can be set.
